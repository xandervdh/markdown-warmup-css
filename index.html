            <h5 class="title">A funny story</h5>
            <p>A couple years ago I went on a ski trip with my student club.</p>
            <br>
            <p>One day the apre-ski was going up the mountain with jenever in our backpacks and go sit down and listen
                to music and
                drink jenever.</p>
            <p>When it was time to go I was so drunk that they took my skis and made me walk to the lift to go down. But
                because I
                was drunk I started walking down the mountain</p>
            <p>eventualy taking steps of more than 2 meter because it was a black slope.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Eventually I blacked out after I started rolling down the mountain.</p>
            <p>Then afterwards I heard stories that I was skiing down the mountain without skis and when we were in the
                village that
                there where to guys</p>
            <p>laughing at me who eventually helped me go through the village to the bus stop.</p>
            <p>Just imagine me hanging between two big dudes XD</p>
            <br>
            <h6 class="title">TL;DR</h6>
            <p>When I was on a ski trip at one point I was skiing down the mountain without skis.</p>
